1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, and special characters  
   - Tokenization & stopword removal  
   - Converting text to lowercase  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - TF-IDF vectorization  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Trained a machine learning model on **1.6M tweets**  
   - Final model saved as `trained_model.sav`  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy
